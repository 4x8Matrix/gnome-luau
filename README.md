## Gnome Luau

Gnome Luau was supposed to be some sort of Binding for Luau -> Gnome Shell.

But the IPC route I initially wanted to go down is mostly borked, borked because Gnome as of v41 is *safer* ðŸ¤¡

I think the only genuine way on creating bindings at this point is to adopt gjs, which i'll look into.
